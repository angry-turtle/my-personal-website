                        At first I was all about Artifact being mainly focused on constructed in tournaments,but after seing the preview tournament i got hooked by it being draft based. A small analogy i thought of is, if you imagine a Dota2 tournament, where every team would
                        play mostly the same 5 heroes vs. the same 5 heroes every game and the only changing variable would be the team who got to play those pre set "Decks", it would kinda be repetitive and tiring, for the player and the spectator (resembling
                        constructed in Artifact). But if you draft heroes for every game, like you actually do in a Dota2 tournament, you create each time an unique "Deck" and every game you play is different. (resembling drafting in Artifact).

                        for Hotline Miami eventually turned into a fully-fledged game, which the studio plans to reveal as Hotline Miami 2 rather than DLC for the first game. However, Söderström later Tweeted that the team only has some "general plans"

                    The Need for Speed series is 23 years old and in that time the series has reinvented itself more times than I can even count. The most recent reboot of the series happened in 2015 where we saw the spirit of the Underground games from the early 2000s return.
                    While that effort was a good one, it was a relatively short game with a beautiful, but lifeless game world.

                    It was 20 years ago when I joined BioWare – September 8, 1998. I had just finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta and found out through a local TV show that there was a videogame studio right here in Edmonton. I spent
                    the summer talking with the founders, Greg and Ray, about joining BioWare as a Technical Artist, and they offered me a job Back then we were a small independent studio. Under 50 people. But we were working on a game that was highly
                    anticipated around the world. Baldur’s Gate was a few months from release, and even though I was hired as an artist, my first task was to help test its multiplayer feature.
